                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>I have recently finished my bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Engineering at Sheffield Hallam University and thrive to build applications. I mainly focus on web development as I try to be a full stack developer, however, my strengths are in the front-end department currently as I am trying to get used to more back-end technologies. I have started to code back in 2015 using HTML & CSS whilst using PHP. Throughout the years, I have improved my skill sets and started to explore other technologies such as Python, JavaScript, React and few others. Which I have made the decision to purse web development.</p>
